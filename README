NAME
    JSON::Decode::Marpa - JSON parser using Marpa

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.01 of JSON::Decode::Marpa (from Perl
    distribution JSON-Decode-Marpa), released on 2014-08-27.

SYNOPSIS
     use JSON::Decode::Marpa qw(from_json);
     my $data = from_json(q([1, true, "a", {"b":null}]));

DESCRIPTION
    This module is based on MarpaX::Demo::JSONParser and makes it more
    convenient to use. I packaged this for casual benchmarking against
    Pegex::JSON and JSON::Decode::Regexp.

    The result on my computer: Pegex::JSON and JSON::Decode::Marpa are
    roughly the same speed (but Pegex has a much smaller startup overhead
    than Marpa). JSON::Decode::Regexp is about an order of magnitude faster
    than this module, and JSON::XS is about *three orders of magniture*
    faster. So that's that.

FUNCTIONS
  from_json($str) => DATA
    Decode JSON in $str. Dies on error.
